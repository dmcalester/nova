This document has been approved for publication by the Management Council of the
Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and represents the consensus
technical agreement of the participating CCSDS Member Agencies. The procedure for
review and authorization of CCSDS documents is detailed in Organization and Processes for
the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS A02.1-Y-4), and the record of
Agency participation in the authorization of this document can be obtained from the CCSDS
Secretariat at the e-mail address below.

                            STATEMENT OF INTENT
The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) is an organization officially
established by the management of its members. The Committee meets periodically to address
data systems problems that are common to all participants, and to formulate sound technical
solutions to these problems. Inasmuch as participation in the CCSDS is completely
voluntary, the results of Committee actions are termed Recommended Standards and are
not considered binding on any Agency.

This Recommended Standard is issued by, and represents the consensus of, the CCSDS
members. Endorsement of this Recommendation is entirely voluntary. Endorsement,
however, indicates the following understandings:
   o   Whenever a member establishes a CCSDS-related standard, this standard will be in
       accord with the relevant Recommended Standard. Establishing such a standard
       does not preclude other provisions which a member may develop.
   o   Whenever a member establishes a CCSDS-related standard, that member will
       provide other CCSDS members with the following information:
          -- The standard itself.
          -- The anticipated date of initial operational capability.
          -- The anticipated duration of operational service.
   o   Specific service arrangements shall be made via memoranda of agreement. Neither
       this Recommended Standard nor any ensuing standard is a substitute for a
       memorandum of agreement.

No later than five years from its date of issuance, this Recommended Standard will be
reviewed by the CCSDS to determine whether it should: (1) remain in effect without change;
(2) be changed to reflect the impact of new technologies, new requirements, or new
directions; or (3) be retired or canceled.

In those instances when a new version of a Recommended Standard is issued, existing
CCSDS-related member standards and implementations are not negated or deemed to be
non-CCSDS compatible. It is the responsibility of each member to determine when such
standards or implementations are to be modified. Each member is, however, strongly
encouraged to direct planning for its new standards and implementations towards the later
version of the Recommended Standard.

                                     FOREWORD
This document is a Recommended Standard for tracking data messages and has been
prepared by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). The tracking
data message described in this Recommended Standard is the baseline concept for tracking
data interchange applications that are cross-supported between Agencies of the CCSDS.

This Recommended Standard establishes a common framework and provides a common
basis for the format of tracking data exchange between space agencies. It allows
implementing organizations within each Agency to proceed coherently with the development
of compatible derived standards for the flight and ground systems that are within their
cognizance. Derived Agency standards may implement only a subset of the optional features
allowed by the Recommended Standard and may incorporate features not addressed by this
Recommended Standard.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the
subject of patent rights. CCSDS has processes for identifying patent issues and for securing
from the patent holder agreement that all licensing policies are reasonable and non-
discriminatory. However, CCSDS does not have a patent law staff, and CCSDS shall not be
held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

Through the process of normal evolution, it is expected that expansion, deletion, or
modification of this document may occur. This Recommended Standard is therefore subject
to CCSDS document management and change control procedures, which are defined in
Organization and Processes for the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems
(CCSDS A02.1-Y-4). Current versions of CCSDS documents are maintained at the CCSDS
Web site:

# 1 INTRODUCTION
## 1.1 PURPOSE

1.1.1 This Tracking Data Message (TDM) Recommended Standard specifies a standard
message format for use in exchanging spacecraft tracking data between space agencies. Such
exchanges are used for distributing tracking data output from routine interagency cross-
supports in which spacecraft missions managed by one agency are tracked from a tracking
station managed by a second agency. The standardization of tracking data formats facilitates
space agency allocation of tracking sessions to alternate tracking resources.

1.1.2 This document includes requirements and criteria that the message format has been
designed to meet. For exchanges where these requirements do not capture the needs of the
participating Agencies another mechanism may be selected.

## 1.2 SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY

1.2.1 This Recommended Standard contains the specification for a Tracking Data Message
designed for applications involving tracking data interchange between space data systems.
Tracking data includes data types such as Doppler, transmit/received frequencies, range,
angles, Delta-DOR, DORIS, PRARE, media correction, weather, etc. The rationale behind the
design of the message is described in annex G and may help the application engineer construct
a suitable message. It is acknowledged that this version of the Recommended Standard may
not apply to every single tracking session or data type; however, it is desired to focus on
covering most common tracking scenarios, and to expand the coverage in future versions as
necessary.

1.2.2 This message is suited to inter-agency exchanges that involve automated interaction.
The attributes of a TDM make it primarily suitable for use in computer-to-computer
communication because of the large amount of data typically present. The TDM is generally
intended to be used in conjunction with an Interface Control Document (ICD) written jointly
by the service provider and customer agency. The ICD outlines TDM options that have been
exercised in the specific implementation.

1.2.3 Definition of the accuracy pertaining to any particular TDM is outside the scope of
this Recommended Standard and should be specified via an ICD between data exchange
participants.

1.2.4 This Recommended Standard is applicable only to the message format and content, but
not to its transmission. The method of transmitting the message between exchange partners is
beyond the scope of this document and should be specified in the ICD. Message transmission
could be based on a CCSDS data transfer protocol, file based transfer protocol such as Secure
File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), stream-oriented media, or other secure transmission mechanism.
In general, the transmission mechanism must not place constraints on the technical data content
of a TDM.

1.2.5   There are some specific exclusions to the TDM, as listed below:
    a) Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) ‘Fullrate’ and ‘Normal Points’ format (sometimes
       referred to as ‘Quicklook’), which are already transferred via a standardized format
       documented at https://ilrs.cddis.eosdis.nasa.gov/; however, such data could
       conceivably be transferred via TDM with a ‘RANGE’ keyword (see 3.5.2.7);
    b) exchanges of raw Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, which is
       standardized via the RINEX format (http://www.igs.org);
    c) Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) navigation point solutions, which are standardized
       via the SP3 format (https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/orbits/); 1
    d) optical data from navigation cameras (pixel-based, row-column, etc.);
    e) LIDAR data (which may include a laser range finder); however, such data could
       conceivably be transferred via TDM with a ‘RANGE’ keyword (see 3.5.2.7); and
    f) altimeter data; however, such data could conceivably be transferred via TDM with a
       ‘RANGE’ keyword (see 3.5.2.7).

1.2.6   Changes in Version 2 of the Tracking Data Message include the following:

1.2.6.1 Description of the message format based on the use of eXtensible Markup
Language (XML) is now detailed in section 5 of this document.

1.2.6.2 References, including inline references to various Web sites, have been updated as
applicable.

1.2.6.3 The labeling of several annexes has changed, primarily in order to respond to
changing CCSDS document requirements, for example, the Implementation Conformance
Statement (ICS) (annex A) was added, causing several prior annex labels to shift; and the
Security section was converted from a main document section (5) to an annex (annex C).

1.2.6.4 The Space Assigned Numbers Authority (SANA) Registry is now a source of
values for some keywords, as noted in the relevant tables.

1.2.6.5 The word ‘obligatory’ is no longer used; ‘mandatory’ is substituted based on the
requirements of the ICS.

1 It has been suggested that the statement regarding navigation solutions’ being standardized by SP3 is not
correct, because SP3 prescribes equidistant data (ephemerides), which are in general not provided by each
GPS/GNSS receiver. It was proposed that the navigation solution data (epoch, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz) should be
provided in the TDM, with the velocities as optional values. However, this would require major changes to the
TDM that are contrary to its intended purpose. As an alternative, the CCSDS Orbit Data Messages Orbit
Ephemeris Message (OEM) (see reference [4]) could be used to convey the navigation solution if all position
and velocity components are transferred. The OEM is already set up to convey all the required values and can
be used to convey orbit reconstructions as well as orbit predictions.

1.2.6.6 There are several new Data Section keywords added based on
suggestions/recommendations by TDM version 1 users. These include transmit/receive
phase; optical magnitude and radar cross section based on space situational awareness
applications; and Doppler counts. For each of these new data types there are one or more
related Metadata Section keywords.

## 1.3 CONVENTIONS AND DEFINITIONS

### 1.3.1 GENERAL

Conventions and definitions of navigation concepts such as reference frames, time systems,
etc., are provided in reference [F7]. (Also see SANA Registries specified in annex C.)

### 1.3.2 NORMATIVE TEXT

The following conventions apply for the normative specifications in this Recommended
Standard:
      a) the words ‘shall’ and ‘must’ imply a binding and verifiable specification;
      b) the word ‘should’ implies an optional, but desirable, specification;
      c) the word ‘may’ implies an optional specification;
      d) the words ‘is’, ‘are’, and ‘will’ imply statements of fact.

NOTE – These conventions do not imply constraints on diction in text that is clearly
       informative in nature.

### 1.3.3 INFORMATIVE TEXT

In the normative sections of this document (sections 3–5), informative text is set off from the
normative specifications either in notes or under one of the following subsection headings:
      –   Overview;
      –   Background;
      –   Rationale;
      –   Discussion.

### 1.3.4 DEFINITIONS

1.3.4.1    Terms

participant: An entity that has the ability to acquire, broadcast, or reflect navigation
messages and/or electromagnetic frequencies, for example, a spacecraft, a quasar, a tracking
station, a tracking instrument, or an agency center, as discussed in reference [F7]. Thus there
may exist Tracking Data Messages for which there is no applicable spacecraft.

agency: An exchange partner.

NOTE – This usage results from the history of the CCSDS, which was formed as a
       coalition of the world’s space agencies. Over time, as the space industry and the
       CCSDS have evolved, there is a wider group of organizations (e.g., military,
       commercial) that could utilize CCSDS standards. In this document, the term
       ‘agency’ is meant to encompass any and all of these exchange partners.

n/a, N/A: Not applicable or not available.

1.3.4.2    Unit Notations

The following conventions for unit notations apply throughout this Recommended Standard.
Insofar as possible, an effort has been made to use units that are part of the International
System of Units (SI Units); units are either SI base units, SI derived units, or units outside

# 2 OVERVIEW
## 2.1 GENERAL

This section provides a high-level overview of the CCSDS recommended Tracking Data
Message, a message format designed to facilitate standardized exchange of spacecraft
tracking data between space agencies.

## 2.2 THE TRACKING DATA MESSAGE (TDM) BASIC CONTENT

2.2.1 The TDM is realized as a sequence of ASCII text lines (reference [2]), which may be
in either a file format or a real-time stream. The content is separated into three basic types of
computer data structure as described in section 3. The TDM architecture takes into account
that some aspects of tracking data change on a measurement-by-measurement basis (data);
some aspects change less frequently, but perhaps several times per track (metadata); and
other aspects change only rarely, for example, once per track or perhaps less frequently
(header). The TDM makes it possible to convey a variety of tracking data used in the orbit
determination process in a single data message (e.g., standard Doppler and range
radiometrics in a variety of tracking modes, transmit/receive frequencies, VLBI data, antenna
pointing angles, etc.). To aid in precision trajectory modeling, additional ancillary
information may be included within a TDM if it is desired and/or available (e.g., media
corrections, meteorological data, clock data, and other ancillary data). Facilities for
documenting comments are provided.

2.2.2 The Tracking Data Message in this version of the Recommended Standard is ASCII-
text formatted. While binary-based tracking data message formats are computer efficient and
minimize overhead during data transfer, there are ground-segment applications for which an
ASCII character-based message is more appropriate. For example, ASCII format character-
based tracking data representations are useful in transferring data between heterogeneous
computing systems, because the ASCII character set is nearly universally used and is
interpretable by all popular systems. In addition, direct human-readable dumps of text to
displays, emails, documents, or printers are possible without preprocessing. The penalty for
this convenience is some measure of inefficiency (based on early tests, such penalty would
be greatly reduced if the data is compressed for transmission).

2.2.3 The ASCII text in a TDM can be exchanged in either of two formats: a KVN format
or an XML format. The KVN formatted TDM and XML formatted TDM are described in
this document. Further information on XML is detailed in an integrated XML schema
document for all Navigation Data Messages (reference [9]). It is recommended that
exchange participants specify in the ICD which TDM ASCII format will be exchanged, the
KVN or the XML format.

2.2.4 Normally a TDM will contain tracking data for a single spacecraft participant, unless
the tracking session is spacecraft-to-spacecraft in nature. If a tracking operation involves
information from multiple spacecraft participants tracked from the ground, the data may be

included in a single TDM by using multiple segments (see 3.1); or multiple TDMs may be
used, one per spacecraft participant.

2.2.5 For a given spacecraft participant, multiple tracking data messages could be provided
in a message exchange session to achieve the tracking data requirements of the participating
agencies (e.g., launch supports with periodically delivered TDMs, or other critical events
such as maneuvers, encounters, etc.).

2.2.6 Provisions for the frequency of exchange and special types of exchanges should be
specified in an ICD.

# 3 TRACKING DATA MESSAGE STRUCTURE AND CONTENT
## 3.1 GENERAL

3.1.1 The TDM shall consist of digital data represented as ASCII text lines (see reference [2])
in KVN format (see section 4) or XML format (see section 5). The lines constituting a TDM
shall be represented as a combination of:
      a) a Header (see 3.2);
      b) a Metadata Section (data about data) (see 3.3); and
      c) a Data Section (tracking data represented as ‘Tracking Data Records’) (see 3.4, 3.5).
Optional comments may appear in specified locations in the Header, Metadata, and Data
Sections (see 4.5).

3.1.2 Taken together, the Metadata Section and its associated Data Section shall be called a
TDM Segment.

3.1.3 Each TDM shall have a Header and a Body. The TDM Body shall consist of one or
more TDM Segments. There shall be no limit to the number of Segments in a given TDM
Body, beyond practical constraints, as shown in table 3-1. Each Segment shall consist of a
Metadata Section and a Data Section that consists of a minimum of one Tracking Data
Record. Therefore the overall structure of the TDM shall be:
      –   TDM = Header + Body;
      –   Body = Segment [+ Segment + … + Segment];
      –   Segment = Metadata Section + Data Section;
      –   Data Section = Tracking Data Record (TDR) [ + TDR + TDR … + TDR].

                                                            Data n

3.1.4 The TDM shall consist of tracking data for one or more tracking participants (see
1.3.4.1) at multiple epochs contained within a specified time range. Generally, but not
necessarily, the time range of a TDM may correspond to a ‘tracking pass’.

3.1.5   It shall be possible to exchange a TDM either as a real-time stream or as a file.

3.1.6 The TDM file naming scheme should be agreed to on a case-by-case basis between
the participating agencies, and should be specified in an ICD.

3.1.7 The method of exchanging TDMs shall be decided on a case-by-case basis by the
participating agencies and should be documented in an ICD. The exchange method shall not
constrain the tracking data content.

## 3.2 TDM HEADER

3.2.1 The TDM shall include a Header that consists of information that identifies the basic
parameters of the message. The first Header line must be the first non-blank line in the
message.

3.2.2 A description of TDM Header items and values is provided in table 3-2, which
specifies for each item:
      –   the keyword to be used;
      –   a short description of the item;
      –   examples of allowed values; and
      –   whether the item is mandatory or optional.

3.2.3 Only those keywords shown in table 3-2 shall be used in a TDM Header. The order of
occurrence of the mandatory and optional KVN assignments shall be fixed as shown in
table 3-2.

                   The format and content of the
                   message identifier value are at the
                   discretion of the originator.

3.2.4 Each line in the TDM Header, with the exception of COMMENTs, shall have the
following generic format:

                                         keyword = value

3.2.5 The TDM Header shall provide a CCSDS Tracking Data Message version number
that identifies the format version; this is included to anticipate future changes and to provide
the ability to extend the standard with no disruption to existing users. The version keyword is
CCSDS_TDM_VERS and the value shall have the form of x.y where y is incremented for
corrections and minor changes, and x is incremented for major changes. Versions x.0, where
x≥1, shall be reserved for versions accepted by the CCSDS as an official Recommended
Standard (‘Blue Book’). Interagency testing of TDMs shall be conducted using version
numbers less than 1.0 (e.g., ‘0.y’). Specific TDM versions that will be exchanged between
agencies should be documented via the ICD.

3.2.6 The TDM Header shall include the CREATION_DATE keyword with the value set to
the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when the data was created (file creation time if in file
format, or first data point in stream), as specified in 4.3.9.

## 3.3 TDM METADATA

### 3.3.1 GENERAL

3.3.1.1 The TDM shall include at least one Metadata Section that contains configuration
details (metadata) applicable to the Data Section in the same TDM Segment. The
information in the Metadata Section aligns with the tracking data to provide descriptive
information (typically, the metadata is the type of information that does not change
frequently during a tracking session).

3.3.1.2 Each line in the TDM Metadata Section, with the exception of COMMENTs, shall
have the following generic format:

                                       keyword = value

3.3.1.3     A single TDM Metadata Section shall precede each Data Section.

3.3.1.4 When there are changes in the values assigned to any of the keywords in the
Metadata Section, a new Segment must be started (e.g., mode change from one-way to two-
way tracking).

3.3.1.5 The first and last lines of a TDM Metadata Section shall consist of the
META_START and META_STOP keywords, respectively. These keywords are used to
facilitate parsing.

3.3.1.6     Table 3-3 specifies for each Metadata item:
      –   the keyword to be used;
      –   a short description of the item;
      –   a list of required values or examples of allowed values; and
      –   whether the item is mandatory or optional.
The column marked ‘N/E’ will contain an ‘N’ if the column marked ‘Normative Values /
Examples’ contains normative values, and will contain an ‘E’ if the column contains example
values that are non-normative. For normative values, a fully enumerated set of values is
provided.

3.3.1.7 Only those keywords shown in table 3-3 shall be used in a TDM Metadata Section.
Mandatory items shall appear in every TDM Metadata Section. Items that are optional may
or may not appear in any given TDM Metadata Section, at the discretion of the data
producer, based on the requirements of the data and its intended application (see annex I for
a TDM Summary Sheet that illustrates the relationships between data types and metadata).
For most metadata keywords there is no default value; where there is a default value, it is
specified at the end of the ‘Description’ section for the given keyword. If a keyword is not
present in a TDM, and a default value is defined, the default shall be assumed.

3.3.1.8 The order of occurrence of the mandatory and optional KVN assignments shall be
fixed as shown in table 3-3.

3.3.1.9 The Metadata Section shall describe the participants in a tracking session using the
keyword ‘PARTICIPANT_n’. There may be several participants associated with a tracking
data session (the number of participants is always greater than or equal to one, and generally
greater than or equal to two). The ‘n’ in the keyword is an indexer. The indexer shall not be
the same for any two participants in a given Metadata Section.

3.3.1.10 The value associated with any given PARTICIPANT_n keyword may be a ground
tracking station, a spacecraft, a quasar catalog name; or may include non-traditional objects,
such as landers, rovers, balloons, etc. The list of eligible names that is used to specify
participants should be documented in the ICD. Subsections 3.3.2 through 3.3.2.7 identify the
relationships between the MODE, the PATH, and PARTICIPANT_n keywords for typical
tracking sessions. Participants may generally be listed in any order.

3.3.1.11 In this version of the TDM, the maximum number of participants per segment shall
be five. If more than five participants are defined (i.e., PARTICIPANT_6 +), then special
arrangements between exchange participants are necessary. These arrangements should be
documented in an ICD. It should be noted that although the restriction to five participants
may appear to be a constraint it is probably not, because of other aspects of the TDM
structure. Five participants easily allow the user to describe the great majority of tracking
passes. In some cases there may be ‘critical event’ tracking sessions in which a single
spacecraft is tracked by a large number of antennas, such that the total number of participants
appears to be six or more. However, because of the nature of the ‘PATH’ keyword, several
TDM Segments with five or fewer participants would be required to describe the full set of
tracking data. For the critical event example scenario just given, one TDM Segment would
be used to describe the two-way connection, and one additional segment would be required
for each three-way connection; it would not be possible to provide a single ‘PATH’
statement that would convey the multiple signal paths.

                            Table 3-3: TDM Metadata Section

Keyword                Description                                    Normative Values /       N/E Mandatory
                                                                      Examples
META_START             The META_START keyword shall delineate N/A                              ----- Yes
                       the start of the TDM Metadata Section
                       within the message. It must appear on a
                       line by itself; that is, it shall have no
                       parameters, timetags or values.
COMMENT                (See 4.5.) It should be noted that if          COMMENT file = tdm.dat   E     No
                       comments are used in the metadata, they
                       shall only appear at the beginning of the
                       Metadata Section.
TRACK_ID               The TRACK_ID keyword specifies a               20190918_1200135-0001    E     No
                       unique identifier for the tracking data in the
                       associated data section. The value may be a
                       freely selected string of characters and
                       numbers, only required to be unique for
                       each track of the corresponding sensor.
                       For example, the value may be constructed
                       from the measurement date and time and a
                       counter to distinguish simultaneously
                       tracked objects.
DATA_TYPES             Comma-separated list of data types in the      RANGE                    E     No
                       Data Section. The elements of the list shall   TRANSMIT_FREQ_n
                       be selected from the data types shown in       RECEIVE_FREQ
                       table 3-5, with the exception of the
                       DATA_START, DATA_STOP, and
                       COMMENT keywords.
TIME_SYSTEM            The TIME_SYSTEM keyword shall specify UTC, TAI, GPS,                    E     Yes
                       the time system used for timetags in the     SCLK
                       associated Data Section. This should be UTC
                       for ground-based data. The value associated

                      participants must be specified for most
                      sessions; for some special TDMs such as
                      tropospheric media, only one participant
                      need be listed. Participants represent the
                      classical transmitting parties, transponding
                      parties, and receiving parties, while
                      allowing for flexibility to consider tracking
                      sessions that go beyond the familiar one-
                      way spacecraft-to-ground, two-way ground-
                      spacecraft-ground, etc. Participants may be
                      listed in any order, and the PATH keywords
                      specify the signal paths. For spacecraft
                      identifiers, there is no CCSDS-based
                      restriction on the value for this keyword,

                      for example, in initial space surveillance
                      object detection.
MODE                  The MODE keyword shall reflect the            SEQUENTIAL                N     No

                      Section of the segment. The value
                      ‘SEQUENTIAL’ applies for frequencies,
                      phase, range, Doppler, carrier power,
                      carrier-power-to-noise spectral density,

                      optical, angles, and line-of-sight ionosphere
                      calibrations; the name implies a sequential
                      signal path between tracking participants.
                      The value ‘SINGLE_DIFF’ applies only for
                      differenced data. In other cases, such as
                      troposphere, weather, clocks, etc., use of
                      the MODE keyword does not apply.

                       keyword shall be used if the MODE is
                       SEQUENTIAL (i.e.,
                       MODE=SEQUENTIAL is specified). The
                       indexed ‘PATH_1’ and ‘PATH_2’

TIMETAG_REF              The TIMETAG_REF keyword shall provide TRANSMIT                      N     No
                         a reference for time tags in the tracking data. RECEIVE
                         This keyword indicates whether the timetag
                         associated with the data is the transmit time
                         or the receive time. This keyword is
                         provided specifically to accommodate two
                         special cases: (1) systems where a received

                         anticipated otherwise that transmit-related
                         data will generally be timetagged with the
                         time of transmission, and that receive-related
                         data will generally be timetagged with the
                         time of receipt; in these two standard cases, it
                         is not necessary to specify the

                       frequency observable is transferred instead
                       of the actual received frequency. The data

                       carrier, and the range unit must be defined
                       in an ICD; ‘CONSTANT’, in which case
                       the range tones have a constant frequency;
                       or ‘ONE_WAY’ (used in Delta-DOR).

                                   is coherent or non-coherent. For
                                   ESA and JAXA, it is important
                                   for the two/three-way Doppler to
                                   be coherent, but not the RANGE.
                                   This keyword may not be

         sessions (e.g., one-way, two-way, three-way, etc.).         Annex I supplies
         recommendations of the metadata keywords that should be used to properly
         describe the tracking data of various types depending on the settings of the
         MODE and PATH keywords, with allowance for characteristics of the uplink
         frequency (if applicable).

  3.3.2.1     One-Way Data

  3.3.2.1.1    The setting of the ‘MODE’ keyword shall be ‘SEQUENTIAL’.

  3.3.2.1.2 For one-way data, the signal path generally originates at the spacecraft
  transmitter, so the spacecraft’s participant number shall be the first number in the value
  assigned to the PATH keyword. The receiver, which may be a tracking station or another
  spacecraft, shall be represented by the second number in the value of the PATH keyword.

  EXAMPLES – ‘PATH=1,2’ indicates transmission from PARTICIPANT_1 to
             PARTICIPANT_2;     ‘PATH=2,1’    indicates transmission from
             PARTICIPANT_2 to PARTICIPANT_1.

3.3.2.1.3 To facilitate generation of the one-way tracking observable, the nominal
spacecraft transmit frequency should be provided via a TRANSMIT_FREQ_n keyword in
TDMs that contain one-way receive frequency data. The transmit frequency data may be in
the same segment as the receive frequency data, or a separate segment, at the preference of
the TDM originator.

NOTE – Figures E-1 and E-2 are examples TDMs containing one-way tracking data.

3.3.2.2     Two-Way Data

3.3.2.2.1    The setting of the ‘MODE’ keyword shall be ‘SEQUENTIAL’.

3.3.2.2.2 For two-way data, the signal path originates at a ground antenna (or a ‘first
spacecraft’), so the uplink (or crosslink) transmit participant number shall be the first number
in the value assigned to the PATH keyword. The participant number of the transponder
onboard the spacecraft to which the signal is being uplinked shall be the second number in
the value assigned to the PATH keyword. The third entry in the PATH keyword value shall
be the same as the first (two-way downlink is received at the same participant which
transmits the uplink/crosslink). Both PARTICIPANT_1 and PARTICIPANT_2 may be
spacecraft as in the case of a spacecraft-spacecraft exchange.

EXAMPLES – ‘PATH=1,2,1’ indicates transmission from PARTICIPANT_1 to
           PARTICIPANT_2, with final reception at PARTICIPANT_1;
           ‘PATH=2,1,2’ indicates transmission from PARTICIPANT_2 to
           PARTICIPANT_1, with final reception at PARTICIPANT_2.

NOTE – Figures E-3, E-4, E-9, E-18, E-19, and E-20 are example TDMs containing two-
       way tracking data.

3.3.2.3     Three-Way Data

3.3.2.3.1    The setting of the ‘MODE’ keyword shall be ‘SEQUENTIAL’.

3.3.2.3.2 For three-way data, the signal path originates with a ground station (uplink
antenna), so the participant number of the uplink station shall be the first entry in the value
assigned to the PATH keyword. The participant number of the transponder onboard the
spacecraft to which the signal is being uplinked shall be the second number in the value
assigned to the PATH keyword. The participant number of the downlink antenna shall be the
third number in the value assigned to the PATH keyword.

3.3.2.3.3 For three-way data, the first and last numbers in the value assigned to the PATH
keyword must be different.

EXAMPLES – ‘PATH=1,2,3’ indicates transmission from PARTICIPANT_1                             to
           PARTICIPANT_2, with final reception at PARTICIPANT_3.

NOTE – Figure E-5 is an example TDM containing three-way tracking data.

3.3.2.4     N-Way Data

3.3.2.4.1 One-way, two-way, and three-way tracking cover the bulk of tracking sequences.
However, four-way and greater (n-way) scenarios are possible (e.g., via use of one or more
relay satellites). These may be accomplished via the sequence assigned to the PATH
keyword.

3.3.2.4.2    The setting of the ‘MODE’ keyword shall be ‘SEQUENTIAL’.

3.3.2.4.3 The value assigned to the PATH keyword shall convey the signal path among the
participants followed by the signal; for example, ‘PATH=1,2,3,2,1’ and ‘PATH=1,2,3,4’
represent two different four-way tracking signal paths.

3.3.2.4.4 In this version of the TDM, the maximum number of participants per segment
shall be five. If more than five participants are defined (i.e., PARTICIPANT_6 +), then
special arrangements shall be made by exchange participants; these should be specified in the
ICD.

NOTE – Figure E-6 is an example TDM containing four-way tracking data.

3.3.2.5     Differenced Modes and VLBI Data

3.3.2.5.1 Differenced data and VLBI data may also be exchanged in a Tracking Data
Message. Differenced data may include differenced Doppler and differenced range (see
references [F3] and [F4]).

3.3.2.5.2    The setting of the ‘MODE’ keyword shall be ‘SINGLE_DIFF’.

3.3.2.5.3 When the MODE is ‘SINGLE_DIFF’, two path keywords, ‘PATH_1’ and
‘PATH_2’, shall be used to convey the signal paths that have been differenced.

3.3.2.5.4 When the MODE is ‘SINGLE_DIFF’, the observable shall be calculated by
subtracting the value achieved for the measurement using PATH_1 from the value achieved
using PATH_2, that is, PATH_2 – PATH_1. Only the final observable shall be communicated
via the TDM.

3.3.2.5.5 If the TDM contains differenced Doppler shift data, the ‘RECEIVE_FREQ’
keyword shall be used for the observable (the ‘RECEIVE_FREQ’ keyword is a Data Section
keyword not yet described in the text—see 3.5.2.8).

3.3.2.5.6 If the TDM contains two-way or three-way differenced Doppler data, then a
history of the uplink frequencies shall be provided with the TRANSMIT_FREQ_n keyword
in order to process the data correctly (the ‘TRANSMIT_FREQ_n’ keyword is a Data Section
keyword not yet described in the text—see 3.5.2.9).

3.3.2.5.7 If differenced range is provided, the ‘RANGE’ keyword shall be used for the
observable (the ‘RANGE’ keyword is a Data Section keyword not yet described in the text—
see 3.5.2.7).

3.3.2.5.8 If the TDM contains differenced data collected during a Delta-Differential One
Way Range (Delta-DOR) session with a spacecraft, then the DOR keyword shall be used for
the observable (the ‘DOR’ keyword is a Data Section keyword not yet described in the
text—see 3.5.3.2).

3.3.2.5.9 If the TDM contains differenced data collected during a VLBI session with a
quasar, then the VLBI_DELAY keyword shall be used for the observable (the
‘VLBI_DELAY’ keyword is a Data Section keyword not yet described in the text—see
3.5.3.3).

NOTE – Figures E-10 and E-11 are example TDMs containing single differenced tracking
       data.

3.3.2.6   Angle Data

Angle data is applicable for any tracking scenario where MODE=SEQUENTIAL is
specified, but is based on pointing with respect to the two rightmost participants listed in the
PATH statement (e.g., spacecraft downlink to an antenna, direction of a participant measured
by a navigation camera, etc.).

NOTE – Figures E-8 and E-12 are example TDMs containing angle data.

3.3.2.7   Media, Weather, Ancillary Data

NOTE – Figures E-13 through E-15 are example TDMs containing tracking data related to
       media, weather, and ancillary data.

3.3.2.7.1 When all the data in a TDM Segment is media related, weather related, or
ancillary-data related, then the use of the MODE keyword may or may not apply as discussed
below.

3.3.2.7.2 Data of this type may be relative to a reference location within the tracking
complex; in this case the methods used to extrapolate the measurements to other antennas
should be specified in the ICD. In the case where a reference location is used, there shall be
only one participant (PARTICIPANT_1), which is the reference antenna, and the MODE
keyword shall not be used. This case corresponds to tropospheric correction data, zenith
ionospheric correction data, and weather data.

3.3.2.7.3 When ionospheric charged particle delays are provided for a line-of-sight between
the antenna and a specific spacecraft, the participants include both the antenna and the
spacecraft, the MODE should be set to ‘SEQUENTIAL’, and a standard PATH statement
should be used.

## 3.4 TDM DATA SECTION (GENERAL SPECIFICATION)

3.4.1 The Data Section of the TDM Segment shall consist of one or more Tracking Data
Records. Each Tracking Data Record shall have the following generic format:

                             keyword = timetag measurement

NOTE – More detail on the generic format of a Tracking Data Record is shown in table 3-4.

                      Table 3-4: Tracking Data Record Generic Format

Element                           Description                              Examples                Mandatory
<keyword>                         Data type keyword from the list          (See annex E.)          Yes (at least
                                  specified in 3.5.                                                one keyword
                                                                                                   must be used)
  =                               Equals sign                              =                       Yes
                <timetag>         Time associated with the tracking        2003-205T18:00:01.275   Yes
                                  observable according to the              2003-205T18:00:01Z
                                  TIME_SYSTEM keyword. (For
                                  requirements on the timetag, see 3.4.8
value                             through 3.4.12. For format
                                  specification, see 4.3.9. )
                <measurement>     Tracking observable (measurement or      (See 3.5.)              Yes
                                  calculation) in units defined in the
                                  TDM.

3.4.2     Each Tracking Data Record must be provided on a single line.

3.4.3 Each Tracking Data Record shall contain a value that depends upon the data type
keyword used. The value shall consist of two elements: a timetag and a tracking observable
(a measurement or calculation based on measurements); either without the other is useless
for tracking purposes. Hereafter, the term ‘measurement’ shall be understood to include
calculations based on measurements as noted above.

3.4.4 At least one blank character must be used to separate the timetag and the observable
in the value associated with each Tracking Data Record.

3.4.5     Applicable keywords and their associated characteristics are detailed in 3.5.

3.4.6 There shall be no mandatory keywords in the Data Section of the TDM Segment,
with the exception of ‘DATA_START’ and ‘DATA_STOP’, because the data presented in
any given TDM is dependent upon the characteristics of the data collection activity.

3.4.7 The Data Section of the TDM Segment shall be delineated by the ‘DATA_START’ and
‘DATA_STOP’ keywords. These keywords are intended to facilitate parsing, and will also
serve to advise the recipient that all the Tracking Data Records associated with the immediately
preceding TDM Metadata Section have been received. The TDM recipient may process the
‘DATA_STOP’ keyword as a ‘local’ end-of-file marker.

3.4.8 Tracking data shall be tagged according to the value of the ‘TIME_SYSTEM’
metadata keyword.

3.4.9 Interpretation of the timetag for transmitted data is straightforward; it is the transmit
time. Interpretation of the timetag for received data is determined by the values of the
‘TIMETAG_REF’, ‘INTEGRATION_REF’, and ‘INTEGRATION_INTERVAL’ keywords,
as applicable (see table 3-3 and 3.5.2.8). For other data types (e.g., meteorological, media,
clock bias/drift), the timetag represents the time the measurement was taken.

3.4.10 In general, no required ordering of Tracking Data Records shall be imposed, because
there are certain scenarios in which data are collected from multiple sources that are not
processed in strictly chronological order. Thus it may only be possible to generate data in
chronological order if it is sorted post-pass. However, there is one ordering requirement
placed on Tracking Data Records; specifically, in any given Data Section, the data for any
given keyword shall be in chronological order. Also, some TDM creators may wish to sort
tracking data by keyword rather than by timetag. Special sorting requirements should be
specified in the ICD.

3.4.11 Each keyword/timetag combination must be unique within a given Data Section (i.e.,
a given keyword/timetag combination shall not be repeated in the same set of Tracking Data
Records).

3.4.12 The time duration between timetags may be constant, or may vary, within any given
TDM.

3.4.13 Every tracking instrument shall have a defined reference location. This reference
location shall not depend on the observing geometry. The tracking instrument locations
should be conveyed via an ICD. The ICD information should include a complete description
of the station locations and characteristics, including the antenna coordinates with their
defining system, plate motion, and the relative geometry of the tracking point and cross axis
of the antenna mount, accommodations for antenna tilt to avoid keyhole problems, etc. The
station location could be provided via an OPM (reference [4]). Antenna geometry may be
necessary for exceptional cases, where the station location is not fixed during track, for
example.

3.4.14 The measurement shall be converted to an equipment-independent quantity; for
example, frequencies shall be reported at the ‘sky level’ (i.e., actual transmitted/received
frequencies, unless the FREQ_OFFSET keyword is used in the metadata). It should not be
necessary for the data recipient to have detailed information regarding the internal network
of the data producer.

3.4.15 Tracking data is normally subject to a number of corrections, as described in the
following paragraphs.

3.4.15.1 The tracking data measurements shall be corrected with the best estimate of all
known instrument calibrations, such as path delay calibrations between the reference point
and the tracking equipment, if applicable.

NOTE     – These measures should reduce the requirement for consumers of tracking data to
           have detailed knowledge of the underlying structure of the hardware/software
           system that performed the measurements.

3.4.15.2 Tracking data should be corrected for ground delays only. The corrections that
have been applied may be specified to the message recipient via use of the optional
‘CORRECTION_*’ keywords in the metadata.

NOTE     – The ‘TRANSMIT_DELAY’ and ‘RECEIVE_DELAY’ keywords do not
           represent ‘ground corrections’ per se. They are meant to convey gross factors
           that do not change from pass-to-pass (or contact-to-contact). However, if
           exchange partners agree via the ICD, ‘TRANSMIT_DELAY’ and
           ‘RECEIVE_DELAY’ could be removed from the measurements. It is generally
           operationally inconvenient for the producer to treat these values as corrections
           because of the possible requirement to alter uplink timetags; thus these delays
           are best handled in orbit determination post-processing. Modifying timetags to
           account for these delays also complicates the use of differenced measurements.
           It is thus more straightforward to allow the recipient to process these delays
           rather than to correct the data prior to exchange.

3.4.15.3 If correction values are indicated via any of the ‘CORRECTION_*’ keywords, then
the TDM producer must indicate whether these correction values have or have not been applied
to the tracking data. This indication is accomplished via the use of the metadata keyword
‘CORRECTIONS_APPLIED’; this metadata item must have a value of ‘YES’ or ‘NO’.

3.4.15.4 Media corrections (ionosphere, troposphere) should not be applied by the TDM
producer; media corrections may be applied by the TDM recipient using the data conveyed in
the STEC, TROPO_WET, and TROPO_DRY Data Section keywords.

3.4.15.5 The party that will perform any applicable spin corrections should be specified in
the ICD (most appropriate party may be the party that operates the spacecraft).

3.4.15.6 Special correction algorithms that are more complex than a simple scalar value
should be specified in the ICD.

3.4.15.7 Any other corrections applied to the data should be agreed by the service provider
and the customer Agencies and specified in an ICD.

3.4.16 All data type keywords in the TDM Data Section must be from 3.5, which specifies
for each keyword:
    –   the keyword to be used;
    –   applicable units for the associated values;
    –   a reference to the text section where the keyword is described in detail.

NOTES

1       The standard tracking data types are extended to cover also some of the ancillary data
        that may be required for precise orbit determination work. Subsection 3.5 identifies
        the most frequently used data and ancillary types.

2       Annex E provides detailed usage examples.

3       Annex I supplies recommendations of the metadata keywords that should be used to
        properly describe the tracking data of various types depending on the settings of the
        MODE and PATH keywords, with allowance for characteristics of the uplink
        frequency (if applicable).

4       The TDM structure allows a great deal of flexibility in terms of the content of a Data
        Section, as shown in the examples in annex E. However, as a practical consideration
        given the challenges of implementing generic TDM readers, early implementers of
        the TDM have tended to minimize the number of data types represented in any given
        TDM segment. For example, for a two-way tracking pass with ranging, the TDM
        originator may provide three segments, one for transmit frequencies, one for received
        frequencies, and one for range measurements.

## 3.5 TDM DATA SECTION KEYWORDS

### 3.5.1 OVERVIEW

This subsection describes each of the keywords that may be used in the Data Section of the
TDM Segment. In general, there is no required order in the Data Section of the TDM
Segment. Exceptions are the ‘DATA_START’ and ‘DATA_STOP’ keywords, which must
be the first and last keywords in the Data Section, respectively. For ease of reference,
table 3-5 containing all the keywords sorted in alphabetical order is shown immediately
below. Table 3-6 repeats the information from table 3-5 in category order. Descriptive
information about the keywords is shown starting in 3.5.2. The remainder of this subsection
is organized according to the category of data to which the keyword applies (e.g., all the
signal related keywords are together, all media related keywords are together, etc.).

### 3.5.2 SIGNAL RELATED KEYWORDS

3.5.2.1    CARRIER_POWER

The CARRIER_POWER keyword conveys the strength of the radio signal transmitted by the
spacecraft as received at the ground station or at another spacecraft (e.g., in formation flight).
This reports the strength of the signal received from the spacecraft, in decibels (referenced to
1 watt). The unit for the CARRIER_POWER keyword is dBW. The value shall be a double
precision value, and may be positive, zero, or negative. The value is based on the last leg of
the signal path (PATH keyword), for example, spacecraft downlink to an antenna.
Additional TDM Segments should be used for each participant if it is important to know the
carrier power at each participant in a PATH that involves more than one receiver.

3.5.2.2    DOPPLER_INSTANTANEOUS

The value associated with the DOPPLER_INSTANTANEOUS keyword represents the
instantaneous range rate of the spacecraft. The observable may be one-way, two-way, or
three-way. The value shall be a double precision value and may be negative, zero, or
positive. Units are km/s. In order to ensure that corrections due to the ionosphere and solar
plasma are accurately applied by the recipient, the transmit frequency and receive frequency
should be supplied when this data type is exchanged.

NOTE – The DOPPLER_INSTANTANEOUS assumes a fixed uplink frequency (or one
       with small Round-Trip Light Time [RTLT] errors), and thus should not be used
       in cases where there is a deep space ramped uplink (the TRANSMIT_FREQ and
       RECEIVE_FREQ keywords should be used instead).

3.5.2.3   DOPPLER_INTEGRATED

The value associated with the DOPPLER_INTEGRATED keyword represents the mean
range rate of the spacecraft over the INTEGRATION_INTERVAL specified in the Metadata
Section. The timetag and the time bounds of the integration interval are determined by the
TIMETAG_REF and INTEGRATION_REF keywords. The observable may be one-way,
two-way, or three-way. For one-way data, the observable is the mean range rate of the
spacecraft over the INTEGRATION_INTERVAL. For two-way and three-way data, the
ICD should specify whether the observable is the calculated mean range rate, or half the
calculated mean range rate (due to the signal’s having traveled to the spacecraft and back to
the receiver). The value shall be a double precision value and may be negative, zero, or
positive. Units are km/s. In order to ensure that corrections due to the ionosphere and solar
plasma are accurately applied, the transmit frequency and receive frequency should be
supplied when this data type is exchanged.

NOTE – The DOPPLER_INTEGRATED assumes a fixed uplink frequency (or one with
       small RTLT errors), and thus should not be used in cases where there is a deep
       space ramped uplink (the TRANSMIT_FREQ and RECEIVE_FREQ keywords
       should be used instead).

3.5.2.4   DOPPLER_COUNT

The value associated with the DOPPLER_COUNT keyword represents a count of the
number of times the phase of a received signal slips one cycle with respect to a transmitted
signal (or reference signal). The DOPPLER_COUNT keyword should be used in conjunction
with       the      DOPPLER_COUNT_BIAS,               DOPPLER_COUNT_SCALE,               and
DOPPLER_COUNT_ROLLOVER metadata. The value shall be an integer and should be
positive (though in unlikely cases it may be zero). Units are not applicable. It should be
noted that it may be necessary to process this data type in conjunction with a suitable Orbit
Data Message (ODM, reference [4]) in order to understand the velocity of the spacecraft
transmitter. The calculation to reconstruct the Doppler into units of Hertz is:

{[(DOPPLER_COUNTn+1 – DOPPLER_COUNTn)/(tn+1 – tn)] − DOPPLER_COUNT_BIAS}/DOPPLER_COUNT_SCALE

3.5.2.5   PC_N0

The value associated with the PC_N0 keyword shall be the carrier power to noise spectral
density ratio (Pc/N0). The units for PC_N0 shall be dBHz. The value shall be a double
precision value, and may be positive, zero, or negative.

3.5.2.6   PR_N0

The value associated with the PR_N0 keyword shall be the ranging power to noise spectral
density ratio (Pr/N0). The units for PR_N0 shall be dBHz. It shall be a double precision
value, and may be positive, zero, or negative.

#### 3.5.2.7 RANGE

The value associated with the RANGE keyword is the range observable. The values
represent measurements from ambiguous ranging systems, differenced range, skin radar,
proximity radar, or similar radar. The units for RANGE shall be as determined by the
‘RANGE_UNITS’ metadata keyword (i.e., either ‘km’, ‘s’, or ‘RU’).                            The
‘RANGE_UNITS’ metadata keyword should always be specified, but if it is not, the default
(preferred) value shall be ‘km’. If different range units are used by the tracking agency (e.g.,
‘DSN range units’), the definition of the range unit should be described in the ICD. It should
be noted that for many applications, proper processing of the RANGE will require a time
history of the uplink frequencies.            If ambiguous range is provided (i.e., the
RANGE_MODULUS is non-zero), then the RANGE does not represent the actual range to
the spacecraft; a calculation using the RANGE_MODULUS and the RANGE observable
must be performed. For two-way and three-way data, the ICD should specify whether the
observable is based upon the round trip light time, or half the round trip light time (due to the
signal’s having traveled to the spacecraft and back to the receiver). If differenced range is
provided (MODE = SINGLE_DIFF), the ‘RANGE’ keyword shall be used to convey the
difference in range. The value shall be a double precision value, and is generally positive
(exceptions to this could occur if the data is a differenced type, or if the observable is a one-
way pseudorange).

NOTE – The TDM specifically excludes Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), which is already
       transferred via an internationally standardized format documented at
       https://ilrs.cddis.eosdis.nasa.gov/.

3.5.2.8   RECEIVE_FREQ (and RECEIVE_FREQ_n)

3.5.2.8.1 The RECEIVE_FREQ keyword shall be used to indicate that the values represent
measurements of the received frequency. It is suitable for use with deep space ramped uplink if
the TRANSMIT_FREQ is also exchanged. The keyword is indexed to accommodate a
scenario in which multiple downlinks are used; it may also be used without an index where the
frequency cannot be associated with a particular participant (e.g., in the case of a differenced
Doppler shift measurement). The value associated with the RECEIVE_FREQ keyword shall
be the average frequency observable over the INTEGRATION_INTERVAL specified in the
metadata, at the measurement timetag. The interpretation of the timetag shall be determined by
the combined settings of the TIMETAG_REF, INTEGRATION_REF, and
INTEGRATION_INTERVAL keywords (see table 3-3 for a description of how the settings of
these values affect the interpretation of the timetag).              Correlation between the
RECEIVE_FREQ and the associated TRANSMIT_FREQ may be determined via the use of an

a priori estimate and should be resolved via the orbit determination process. The units for
RECEIVE_FREQ shall be Hertz (Hz). The value shall be a double precision value (generally
positive, but could be negative or zero if used with the ‘FREQ_OFFSET’ metadata keyword).

3.5.2.8.2 Using the RECEIVE_FREQ, the instantaneous Doppler measurement in Hz is
calculated as follows:

                                         Dm = ((Ft*tr)−Fr),

where ‘Dm’ is the Doppler measurement, ‘Ft’ is the transmitted frequency, ‘tr’ is the
transponder ratio (tr=1 for one-way), and ‘Fr’ is the RECEIVE_FREQ.

For integrated Doppler, the Doppler measurement in Hz is calculated as follows, where t is
the timetag, and Δt is the value assigned to the INTEGRATION_INTERVAL keyword:
                                                     1
                                                t + ( +α ) ∆t
                                                     2
                                         1
                                  ∆m =
                                         ∆t          ∫ ((F * tr ) − F )dt .
                                                    −1
                                                            t        r
                                               t + ( +α ) ∆t
                                                    2

The limits of integration are determined by the INTEGRATION_REF keyword in the metadata;
the constant α in the equation has the value –½, 0, or ½ for the INTEGRATION_REF values of
‘END’, ‘MIDDLE’, or ‘START’, respectively (see reference [F4]).

INTEGRATION_REF          END                          MIDDLE                  START
α                        α = −½                       α=0                     α=½
Upper Limit              t                            t + ½Δt                 t + Δt
Lower Limit              t − Δt                       t − ½Δt                 t

3.5.2.8.3 If differenced Doppler is provided, the non-indexed ‘RECEIVE_FREQ’ keyword
shall be used to convey the difference in Hz.

3.5.2.8.4 The transponder ratios used for interagency exchanges should be specified in the
ICD if they are always constant. They may also be specified in the metadata by using the
TURNAROUND_NUMERATOR and TURNAROUND_DENOMINATOR keywords.

3.5.2.8.5 The equation for four-way Doppler, if it is to be exchanged, should be in the ICD
since the four-way connections tend to be implementation dependent.

3.5.2.9   TRANSMIT_FREQ_n

The TRANSMIT_FREQ keyword shall be used to indicate that the values represent
measurements of a transmitted frequency, for example, from an uplink operation. The
TRANSMIT_FREQ keyword is indexed to accommodate scenarios in which multiple
transmitters are used. The value associated with the TRANSMIT_FREQ_n keyword shall be
the starting frequency observable at the timetag. The units for TRANSMIT_FREQ_n shall be
Hertz (Hz). The value shall be a positive double precision value. The turnaround ratios
necessary to calculate the predicted receive frequency may be specified using the
TURNAROUND_NUMERATOR and TURNAROUND_DENOMINATOR metadata
keywords, or may be specified in the ICD. In the case of software defined radios, the metadata
keywords may be preferable as the ratios can change with some regularity and it is necessary to
get the applicable ratio with the tracking data. Usage notes: when the data mode is one-way
(i.e., MODE=SEQUENTIAL, PATH=1,2 or PATH=2,1), the signal is at the beacon frequency
transmitted from the spacecraft. If a given spacecraft has more than one transponder, then there
should be unique names specified for each transponder (e.g., Cassini_S, Cassini_X,
Cassini_Ka). If a TDM is constructed with only transmit frequencies, then the MODE is
‘SEQUENTIAL’ and the PATH keyword defines the signal path. Generally the timetag for the
TRANSMIT_FREQ_n keywords should be the time that the signal was transmitted. For quasar
DOR, the TRANSMIT_FREQ_n is the interferometer reference frequency at the receive time
(thus TIMETAG_REF=RECEIVE for this case). If the transmit frequency varies in the TDM
segment, then the TRANSMIT_FREQ_RATE_n keyword should be used to convey the
frequency rate between transmit frequencies (see next section); otherwise, the frequency rate is
assumed to be zero and a step function results.

3.5.2.10 TRANSMIT_FREQ_RATE_n

The value associated with the TRANSMIT_FREQ_RATE_n keyword is the linear rate of
change of the frequency starting at the timetag and continuing until the next
TRANSMIT_FREQ_RATE timetag (or until the end of the data). The units for
TRANSMIT_FREQ_RATE_n shall be Hertz-per-second (Hz/s). The value shall be a double
precision value, and may be negative, zero, or positive. If the TRANSMIT_FREQ_RATE_n
is not specified, it is assumed to be zero (i.e., constant frequency).

3.5.2.11 RECEIVE_PHASE_CT_n

The value associated with the RECEIVE_PHASE_CT keyword is the number of phase cycles
at the receiver. There are no applicable units for the RECEIVE_PHASE_CT. The keyword is
indexed to enable association with the PARTICIPANT_n. The value shall be a string
representing a real number that can be any number of digits required to convey the necessary
precision. If the received phase difference over a time interval is not based on the true
frequency but an intermediate frequency from which the true received frequency is calculated,
the FREQ_OFFSET metadata keyword should be specified to provide the intermediate
frequency.

3.5.2.12 TRANSMIT_PHASE_CT_n

The value associated with the TRANSMIT_PHASE_CT keyword is the number of phase
cycles at the transmitter. The TRANSMIT_FREQ keyword is indexed to enable association
with the PARTICIPANT_n. There are no applicable units for the TRANSMIT_PHASE_CT.
The value shall be a string representing a real number that can be any number of digits
required to convey the necessary precision. If the transmit phase difference over a time
interval is not based on the true frequency but an intermediate frequency from which the true
transmit frequency is calculated, the FREQ_OFFSET metadata keyword should be used to
provide the intermediate frequency. If the uplink frequency is not constant then the
INTERPOLATION and INTERPOLATION_DEGREE metadata keywords shall be used to
characterize the uplink behavior.

### 3.5.3 VLBI AND DELTA-DOR RELATED KEYWORDS

3.5.3.1    Overview

In VLBI, a signal source is measured simultaneously using two receivers in different antenna
complexes, achieving a long baseline (up to thousands of kilometers). The signals recorded
at the two complexes are correlated and differenced to produce the observable, which may be
further processed by navigation software. ‘Delta-DOR’ sessions are a VLBI application in
which the antenna slews from a spacecraft source to a quasar source and back to the
spacecraft during the tracking pass. This sequence may occur multiple times. There are two
data keywords that relate to VLBI and Delta-DOR measurements, and several metadata
keyword settings are applicable (MODE=SINGLE_DIFF, PATH_1 and PATH_2).

#### 3.5.3.2 DOR

The observable associated with the DOR keyword represents the range measured via
PATH_2 minus the range measured via PATH_1. The timetag is the time of signal reception
via PATH_1. This data type is normally used for the spacecraft observable in a Delta-DOR
measurement. The range is either one-way, two-way, or three-way, depending on the values
of the PARTICIPANT_n and PATH keywords. TRANSMIT_FREQ_n shall provide the
spacecraft beacon frequency if one-way, or the transmit frequency at the uplink station if
two-way or three-way, at the signal transmission time. The DOR measurement shall be a
double precision value and may be negative or positive. Units shall be seconds.

3.5.3.3    VLBI_DELAY

The observable associated with the VLBI_DELAY keyword represents the time of signal
arrival via PATH_2 minus the time of signal arrival via PATH_1. The timetag is the time of
signal reception via PATH_1. This data type is normally used for the quasar observable in a
Delta-DOR measurement. TRANSMIT_FREQ_n shall provide the interferometer reference
frequency. The VLBI_DELAY measurement shall be a double precision value and may be
negative or positive. Units shall be seconds.

### 3.5.4 ANGLE DATA KEYWORDS

3.5.4.1    General

Angle data is measured at the ground antenna, using downlink data only, regardless of the
mode of the tracking session. There shall be two angle keywords: ANGLE_1 and
ANGLE_2. The ANGLE_TYPE metadata keyword indicates how these two keywords
should be interpreted. Some TDM users may require that the ANGLE_1 keyword is
followed immediately by the corresponding ANGLE_2 keyword; however, this sort is not a
general TDM requirement. Special sorting requirements should be specified in the ICD.

3.5.4.2    ANGLE_1

The value assigned to the ANGLE_1 keyword represents the azimuth, right ascension, or ‘X’
angle of the measurement, depending on the value of the ANGLE_TYPE keyword. The
angle measurement shall be a double precision value as follows: −180.0 ≤ ANGLE_1 <
360.0. Units shall be degrees.

3.5.4.3    ANGLE_2

The value assigned to the ANGLE_2 keyword represents the elevation, declination, or ‘Y’
angle of the measurement, depending on the value of the ANGLE_TYPE keyword. The
angle measurement shall be a double precision value as follows: −180.0 ≤ ANGLE_2 <
360.0. Units shall be degrees.

### 3.5.5 OPTICAL/RADAR RELATED KEYWORDS

#### 3.5.5.1 MAG

The value assigned to the MAG keyword shall represent the apparent visual magnitude of an
object when observed with an optical telescope. The apparent magnitude of an object is a
measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth, adjusted to the value it would have
in the absence of the atmosphere. Units are not applicable. The MAG measurement shall be a
double precision value and may be positive, zero, or negative.

#### 3.5.5.2 RCS

The value assigned to the Radar Cross Section (RCS) keyword shall represent the radar cross
section of an object being tracked with a radar. The RCS shall be computed from radar
measurements to provide an indication of the detected object size, orientation, and surface
properties. It is the measure of a target’s ability to reflect radar signals in the direction of the
radar receiver. A larger RCS indicates that an object will be more easily detected. The RCS
measurement shall be a positive double precision value. Units shall be square meters (m**2).

### 3.5.6 TIME RELATED KEYWORDS

3.5.6.1    CLOCK_BIAS

In general, the timetags provided for the tracking data should be corrected, but when that is
not possible (e.g., for three-way data or differenced data types), then this data type may be
used. The CLOCK_BIAS keyword can be used by the message recipient to adjust timetag
measurements by a specified amount with respect to a common reference. For example, the
CLOCK_BIAS keyword may be used to show the difference between UTC and a station
clock by setting PARTICIPANT_1 to the name of the station clock and PARTICIPANT_2 to
‘UTC’. The observable should be calculated as clock#2 minus clock#1 (i.e., UTC – ST,
where ST is the station time), consistent with the TDM convention for differenced data. This
parameter may also be used to express the difference between two station clocks, for
example, for differenced data including Delta-DOR. If used for Delta-DOR, only a single
CLOCK_BIAS should be provided per daily VLBI session, with a time-tag strictly before the
first data point (e.g., one minute prior), and with the understanding that the clock will
continue to drift throughout the session. An exception could be made for the (rare) case
where a station clock is adjusted in the middle of a VLBI session, in which case a second
CLOCK_BIAS measurement may be provided. The clock bias is stated in the data, but the
timetags in the message have not been corrected by applying the bias; the message recipient
shall apply the bias to the measurement data. Normally the time related data such as
CLOCK_BIAS data and CLOCK_DRIFT data should appear in a dedicated TDM Segment,
that is, not mixed with signal data or other data types. The units for CLOCK_BIAS shall be
seconds. The value shall be a double precision value, and may be positive, zero, or negative.
The default value shall be 0.0.

3.5.6.2    CLOCK_DRIFT

In general, ground-based clocks in tracking stations are sufficiently stable that a
measurement of the clock drift may not be necessary. However, for spacecraft-to-spacecraft
exchanges, there may be onboard clock drifts that are sufficiently significant that they should
be accounted for in the measurements and calculations. Drift in clocks may also be an
important factor when differenced data is being exchanged. The CLOCK_DRIFT keyword
should be used to adjust timetag measurements by an amount that is a function of time with
respect to a common reference, normally UTC (as opposed to the CLOCK_BIAS, which is
meant to be a constant adjustment). Thus CLOCK_DRIFT could be used to calculate an
interpolated CLOCK_BIAS between two timetags, by multiplying the CLOCK_DRIFT
measurement at the timetag by the number of seconds desired and adding it to the
CLOCK_BIAS. The drift should be calculated as a drift of clock#2 with respect to clock#1,
consistent with the TDM convention for differenced data. Normally the time related data
such as CLOCK_DRIFT data and CLOCK_BIAS data should appear in a dedicated TDM
Segment, that is, not mixed with signal data or other data types. The units for
CLOCK_DRIFT shall be seconds-per-second (s/s). The value shall be a double precision
value, and may be positive, zero, or negative. The default value shall be 0.0.

### 3.5.7 MEDIA RELATED KEYWORDS

#### 3.5.7.1 STEC

The Slant Total Electron Count (STEC) keyword shall be used to convey the line of sight,
one way charged particle delay or total electron count (TEC) at the timetag associated with a
tracking measurement, which is calculated by integrating the electron density along the
propagation path (electrons/m2). The charged particles could have several sources, for
example, solar plasma, Earth ionosphere, or the Io plasma torus. The units for the STEC
keyword are Total Electron Count Units (TECU), where 1 TECU = 1016 electrons/m2 = 1.661
x 10-8 mol/m2 (SI Units). The value shall be a positive double precision value (the TEC
along the satellite line of sight may vary between 1 and 400 TECU; larger values may be
observed during periods of high solar activity). This keyword should appear in its own TDM
Segment with PARTICIPANTs being one spacecraft and one antenna, and a MODE setting
of ‘SEQUENTIAL’. Exchange partners who wish to distinguish between ionospheric and
interplanetary STEC should indicate so in the ICD, and the data must be provided in separate
TDM Segments.

3.5.7.2    TROPO_DRY

The value associated with the TROPO_DRY keyword shall be the dry zenith delay through
the troposphere measured at the timetag. There should be agreed upon elevation mappings
for the dry component specified in the ICD (e.g., the Niell mapping function developed for
VLBI applications). Tropospheric corrections should be applied by the recipient of the
TDM; the required correction is the value associated with this keyword at the timetag.
Recommended polynomial interpolations (if applicable) should be specified in the ICD. The
units for TROPO_DRY shall be meters (m). The value shall be a non-negative double
precision value (0.0 ≤ TROPO_DRY).

3.5.7.3    TROPO_WET

The value associated with the TROPO_WET keyword shall be the wet zenith delay through
the troposphere measured at the timetag. There should be agreed upon elevation mappings
for the wet component specified in the ICD (e.g., the Niell mapping function developed for
VLBI applications). Tropospheric corrections should be applied by the recipient of the
TDM; the required correction is the value associated with this keyword at the timetag.
Recommended polynomial interpolations (if applicable) should be specified in the ICD. The
units for TROPO_WET shall be meters (m). The value shall be a non-negative double
precision value (0.0 ≤ TROPO_WET).

### 3.5.8 METEOROLOGICAL RELATED KEYWORDS

#### 3.5.8.1 PRESSURE

The value associated with the PRESSURE keyword shall be the atmospheric pressure
observable as measured at the tracking participant, specified in hectopascal (1 hectopascal
(hPa) = 1 millibar). The PRESSURE shall be a double precision value; practically speaking
it is always positive.

#### 3.5.8.2 RHUMIDITY

The value associated with the RHUMIDITY keyword shall be the relative humidity
observable as measured at the tracking participant, specified in percent. RHUMIDITY shall
be a double precision type value, 0.0 ≤ RHUMIDITY ≤ 100.0.

#### 3.5.8.3 TEMPERATURE

The value associated with the TEMPERATURE keyword shall be the temperature
observable as measured at the tracking participant, specified in Kelvin (K). The
TEMPERATURE shall be a positive double precision type value.

### 3.5.9 MISCELLANEOUS KEYWORDS

#### 3.5.9.1 COMMENT

The COMMENT keyword is not required. Subsection 4.5 provides full details on usage of
the COMMENT keyword.

3.5.9.2    DATA_START

The ‘DATA_START’ keyword must be the first keyword in the Data Section of the TDM
Segment, which serves to delimit the Data Section. The keyword shall appear on a line by
itself with no timetags or values. Example: ‘DATA_START’.

3.5.9.3    DATA_STOP

The ‘DATA_STOP’ keyword must be the last keyword in the Data Section of the TDM
Segment, which serves to delimit the Data Section. The keyword shall appear on a line by
itself with no timetags or values. Example: ‘DATA_STOP’.

# 4 TRACKING DATA MESSAGE SYNTAX IN KVN
## 4.1 GENERAL

The TDM represented in ‘keyword = value’ syntax, abbreviated as KVN, shall observe the
syntax described in 4.2 through 4.5.

## 4.2 TDM LINES

4.2.1 The TDM shall consist of a set of TDM lines. The TDM line must contain only
printable ASCII characters and blanks. ASCII control characters (such as TAB, etc.) must
not be used, except as indicated below for the termination of the TDM line. A TDM line
must not exceed 254 ASCII characters and spaces (excluding line termination character[s]).

4.2.2    Each TDM line shall be one of the following:
         –    Header line;
         –    Metadata Section line;
         –    Data Section line;
         –    blank line.

4.2.3 All Header, Metadata Section, and Data Section lines, with exceptions as noted
below, shall use KVN.

4.2.4    Only a single ‘keyword = value’ assignment shall be made on a TDM line.

4.2.5    The following distinctions in KVN syntax shall apply for TDM lines:
      a) TDM lines in the Header and Metadata Section shall consist of a keyword, followed
         by an equals sign ‘=’, followed by a single value assignment. Before and after the
         equals sign, blank characters (white space) may be added, but shall not be required.
      b) TDM lines in the Data Section shall consist of a keyword, followed by an equals sign
         ‘=’, followed by a value that consists of two primary elements (essentially an ordered
         pair): a timetag and the measurement or calculation associated with that timetag
         (either without the other is unusable for tracking purposes). Before and after the
         equals sign, blank characters (white space) may be added. The timetag and
         measurement/calculation in the value must be separated by at least one blank
         character (white space).
      c) The keywords COMMENT, META_START, META_STOP, DATA_START, and
         DATA_STOP are exceptions to the KVN syntax.

4.2.6    Keywords must be uppercase and must not contain blanks.

4.2.7 Any white space immediately preceding or following the keyword shall not be
significant.

4.2.8 Any white space immediately preceding or following the equals sign ‘=’ shall not be
significant.

4.2.9    Any white space immediately preceding the end of line shall not be significant.

4.2.10 Blank lines may be used at any position within the TDM.

4.2.11 TDM lines shall be terminated by a single Carriage Return or a single Line Feed or a
Carriage Return/Line Feed pair or a Line Feed/Carriage Return pair.

## 4.3 TDM VALUES

4.3.1    A non-empty value field must be specified for each keyword provided.

4.3.2 Integer values shall consist of a sequence of decimal digits with an optional leading
sign (‘+’ or ‘-’). If the sign is omitted, ‘+’ shall be assumed. Leading zeros may be used.
The range of values that may be expressed as an integer is:

                    −2147483648 ≤ x ≤ +2147483647 (i.e., −231 ≤ x ≤ 231−1).

4.3.3 Non-integer numeric values may be expressed in either fixed-point or floating-point
notation. Both representations may be used within a TDM.

4.3.4 Non-integer numeric values expressed in fixed-point notation shall consist of a
sequence of decimal digits separated by a period as a decimal point indicator, with an
optional leading sign (‘+’ or ‘-’). If the sign is omitted, ‘+’ shall be assumed. Leading and
trailing zeros may be used. At least one digit shall be used before and after a decimal point.
The number of digits shall be 16 or fewer.

4.3.5 Non-integer numeric values expressed in floating-point notation shall consist of a
sign, a mantissa, an alphabetic character indicating the division between the mantissa and
exponent, and an exponent, constructed according to the following rules:
      a) The sign may be ‘+’ or ‘-’. If the sign is omitted, ‘+’ shall be assumed.
      b) The mantissa must be a string of no more than 16 decimal digits with a decimal point
         ‘.’ in the second position of the ASCII string, separating the integer portion of the
         mantissa from the fractional part of the mantissa.
      c) The character used to denote exponentiation shall be ‘E’ or ‘e’. If the character
         indicating the exponent and the following exponent are omitted, an exponent value of
         zero shall be assumed (essentially yielding a fixed-point value).
      d) The exponent must be an integer, and may have either a ‘+’ or ‘-’ sign (if the sign is
         omitted, then ‘+’ is assumed).

     e) The maximum positive floating-point value is approximately 1.798E+308, with 16
        significant decimal digits precision. The minimum positive floating-point value is
        approximately 4.94E−324, with 16 significant decimal digits precision.

NOTE – These specifications for integer, fixed-point, and floating-point values conform to
       the XML specifications for the data types four-byte integer ‘xsd:int’, ‘decimal’,
       and ‘double’, respectively (see reference [5]). The specifications for floating-
       point values conform to the IEEE 754 double precision type (see reference [6]).
       Floating-point numbers in IEEE extended-single or IEEE extended-double
       precision may be represented, but do require an ICD between participating
       agencies because of their implementation specific attributes. The special values
       ‘NaN’, ‘-Inf’, ‘+Inf’, and ‘-0’ are not supported in the TDM.

4.3.6   Blanks shall not be permitted within numeric values and time values.

4.3.7 Text value fields may be constructed using mixed case; case shall not be significant.
All uppercase text values are preferred.

4.3.8 In value fields that are text, an underscore shall be equivalent to a single blank.
Individual blanks between non-blank characters shall be retained (shall be significant) but
multiple blanks shall be equivalent to a single blank.

4.3.9 In value fields that represent a timetag or epoch, one of the following two formats
shall be used:

YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.d→d][Z]

or

YYYY-DDDThh:mm:ss[.d→d][Z]

where ‘YYYY’ is the year, ‘MM’ is the two-digit month, ‘DD’ is the two-digit day, ‘DDD’
is the three-digit day of year, ‘T’ is constant, ‘hh:mm:ss[.d→d]’ is the time in hours, minutes
seconds, and optional fractional seconds; ‘Z’ is an optional time code terminator (the only
permitted value is ‘Z’ for Zulu, i.e., UTC). All fields shall have leading zeros. (See
reference [3], ASCII Time Code A and B.)

4.3.10 There are four types of TDM values that represent a timetag or epoch, as shown in the
applicable tables. The time system for the CREATION_DATE, START_TIME, and
STOP_TIME shall be UTC. The time system for the timetags in the TDM Data Section shall
be determined by the TIME_SYSTEM metadata keyword.

4.3.11 For transmit and receive phase, the value shall be a string representing a real number
that can be any number of digits required to convey the necessary precision. The string must
not contain any alphabetic or special characters.

## 4.4 UNITS IN THE TDM

Units are not explicitly displayed in the TDM. The units associated with values in the TDM
are as specified in table 3-5.

## 4.5 COMMENTS IN A TDM

4.5.1 Comments may be used to provide any pertinent information associated with the data
that is not covered via one of the keywords. This additional information is intended to aid in
consistency checks and elaboration where needed. Comments shall not be required for
successful processing of a TDM; that is, comment lines shall be optional.

NOTE – Given that TDMs may consist of large amounts of data, and are generally produced
       via automation, using the COMMENT feature of the TDM may have limited
       usefulness. On the other hand, a simple utility could be developed to search for
       and extract all the comments in a TDM to make them easily reviewable. Existing
       built-in utilities (e.g., UNIX ‘grep’) or ‘freeware’ utilities could also be used for
       this purpose.

4.5.2    Comment lines, if used, shall only occur:
      a) at the beginning of the TDM Header (i.e., between the CCSDS_TDM_VERS
         keyword and the CREATION_DATE keyword, as shown in table 3-2);
      b) at the beginning of the TDM Metadata Section (i.e., between the META_START
         keyword and the TRACK_ID keyword, as shown in table 3-3);
      c) at the beginning of the TDM Data Section (i.e., between the ‘DATA_START’
         keyword and the first Tracking Data Record).

4.5.3 All comment lines shall begin with the ‘COMMENT’ keyword followed by at least
one space (note: may also be preceded by spaces). The ‘COMMENT’ keyword must appear
on every comment line, not just the first comment line. After the keyword, the remainder of
the line shall be the comment value. White space shall be retained (is significant) in comment
values.

4.5.4 Conventions for particular comments in the TDM that may be required between any
two participating agencies should be specified in the ICD.

4.5.5 Descriptions of any ancillary data that cannot be accommodated via keywords in the
TDM may have to be specified via comments, and should be outlined in the ICD.

         5     TDM CONTENT/STRUCTURE IN XML
         5.1       DISCUSSION—THE TDM/XML SCHEMA

         The TDM/XML schema is available on the SANA Web site. SANA is the registrar for the
         protocol registries created under CCSDS.

         The TDM XML schema explicitly defines the permitted data elements and values acceptable
         for the XML version of the TDM message.

         The location of the TDM/XML schema is:
               –   https://sanaregistry.org/r/ndmxml_unqualified/ndmxml-2.0.0-tdm-2.0.xsd for
                   messages with elements not qualified with respect to a namespace;

Cor. 1
               –   https://sanaregistry.org/r/ndmxml_qualified/ndmxml-2.0.0-tdm-2.0.xsd for messages
                   with elements qualified with respect to a namespace.

               NOTE – Reference [9] subsection 4.3 has more information regarding messages with
                      elements qualified with respect to a namespace.

         Where possible this schema uses simple types and complex types used by the constituent
         schemas that make up NDMs (see reference [9]).

         5.2       TDM/XML BASIC STRUCTURE

         5.2.1     Each TDM shall consist of a <header> and a <body>.

         5.2.2     The TDM <body> shall consist of one or more <segment> constructs.

         5.2.3     Each <segment> shall consist of a <metadata>/<data> pair, as shown in figure 5-1.

                                 <header>
                                 </header>
                                 <body>
                                   <segment>
                                     <metadata>
                                     </metadata>
                                     <data>
                                     </data>
                                   </segment>
                                   <segment>
                                     <metadata>
                                     </metadata>
                                     <data>
                                     </data>
                                   </segment>
                                 </body>

                                    Figure 5-1: TDM XML Basic Structure

5.2.4 XML tags shall be uppercase and correspond with the KVN keywords in section 3 of
this document (uppercase with ‘_’ [the underscore character] as separators). The XML
logical tags related to message structure shall be in lowerCamelCase.

## 5.3 CONSTRUCTING A TDM/XML INSTANCE

### 5.3.1 OVERVIEW

This subsection provides more detailed instructions for the user on how to create an XML
message based on the ASCII-text KVN-formatted message described in section 3.

### 5.3.2 XML VERSION

The first line in the instantiation shall specify the XML version:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

This line must appear on the first line of each instantiation, exactly as shown.

5.3.3   BEGINNING THE INSTANTIATION: ROOT DATA ELEMENT

5.3.3.1 A TDM instantiation shall be delimited with the <tdm></tdm> root element tags
using the standard attributes documented in reference [10].

5.3.3.2 The XML Schema Instance namespace attribute must appear in the root element tag
of all TDM/XML instantiations, exactly as shown:

                xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

5.3.3.3 For messages with elements qualified with respect to a namespace, the NDM/XML
namespace must next be coded, exactly as shown:

                           xmlns:ndm="urn:ccsds:schema:ndmxml"

                                                                                                  Cor. 1
The value that follows the ‘xmlns:’ in the NDM/XML name space (‘ndm’ in this case) is a
prefix that must be used on every XML tag.

NOTE – This xmlns:ndm setting is only necessary for messages with elements qualified
       with respect to a namespace, but it does not hurt anything for it to appear on any
       NDM/XML instantiation.

5.3.3.4 If it is desired to validate an instantiation against the CCSDS Web-based schema,
the xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation attribute must be coded as a single string of non-blank
characters, with no line breaks, exactly as shown:

             –     xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://sanaregistry.org/r/ndmxml_unqualified/n
                   dmxml-2.0.0-master-2.0.xsd" for messages with elements not qualified with respect
                   to a namespace;
Cor. 1       –     xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://sanaregistry.org/r/ndmxml_qualified/ndm
                   xml-2.0.0-master-2.0.xsd" for messages with elements qualified with respect to a
                   namespace.

         NOTE – The length of the value associated with the xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation
                attribute can cause the string to wrap to a new line; however, the string itself
                contains no breaks.

         5.3.3.5 For use in a local operations environment, the schema set may be downloaded from
         the SANA Web site to a local server that meets local requirements for operations robustness.

         5.3.3.6 If a local version is used, the value associated with the xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation
         attribute must be changed to a URL that is accessible to the local server.

         5.3.3.7     The final attributes of the <tdm> tag shall be ‘id’ and ‘version’.

         5.3.3.7.1    The ‘id’ attribute shall be ‘id="CCSDS_TDM_VERS"’.

         5.3.3.7.2    The ‘version’ attribute shall be ‘version="2.0"’.

         NOTES

         1         The following example root element tag for a TDM instantiation combines all the
                   directions in the preceding several subsections for messages with elements not
                   qualified with respect to a namespace:
                   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

                   id="CCSDS_TDM_VERS" version="2.0">

### 5.3.4 THE TDM/XML HEADER SECTION

5.3.4.1 The TDM header shall have a standard header format, with tags <header> and
</header>.

5.3.4.2 Immediately following the <header> tag, the message may have any number of
<COMMENT></COMMENT> tag pairs.

5.3.4.3    The standard TDM header shall contain the following element tags:
   a) <CREATION_DATE>;
   b) <ORIGINATOR>.

NOTE – The rules for these keywords are specified in 3.2. The header would look like
       this:

              <header>
                <COMMENT>Some comment string, which is not required.</COMMENT>
                <CREATION_DATE>2010-03-12T22:31:12.000</CREATION_DATE>
                <ORIGINATOR>NASA</ORIGINATOR>
              </header>

5.3.4.4 An optional <MESSAGE_ID> may be used in the TDM header after the
<ORIGINATOR> keyword.

### 5.3.5 THE TDM/XML BODY SECTION

5.3.5.1    After coding the <header>, the instantiation must include a <body></body> tag pair.

5.3.5.2    The TDM <body> shall consist of one or more <segment> constructs (see figure 5-1).

5.3.5.3    Each <segment> shall consist of a <metadata> section and a <data> section.

5.3.5.4 The keywords in the <metadata> and <data> sections shall be those specified in
table 3-3 and table 3-5, respectively.

5.3.5.5    Tags for TDM keywords shall be all uppercase.

5.3.5.6 TDM/XML keywords that do not correspond directly to a KVN keyword shall be in
‘lowerCamelCase’.

### 5.3.6 THE TDM/XML METADATA SECTION

5.3.6.1 Immediately following the <metadata> tag, the message may have any number of
<COMMENT></COMMENT> tag pairs.

5.3.6.2 Between the <metadata> and </metadata> tags, the keywords shall be those
specified in table 3-3.

### 5.3.7 THE TDM/XML DATA SECTION

5.3.7.1 Each data section shall follow the corresponding metadata section and shall be set
off by the <data></data> tag combination.

5.3.7.2 Immediately following the <data> tag, the message may have any number of
<COMMENT></COMMENT> tag pairs.

5.3.7.3    Between the <data> and </data> tags, the keywords shall be those specified in table 3-5.

### 5.3.8 SPECIAL TDM/XML TAGS

NOTE – In addition to the TDM keywords specified in section 3, there is a special tag
       associated with the TDM body as described in the next subsection.

5.3.8.1 The <observation> tag shall be used to encapsulate the keywords associated with
one of the tracking data types in the TDM.

5.3.8.2    The <observation> tag shall consist of two subcomponents:

      a) the time tag (<EPOCH> tag); and

      b) one specific data type (e.g., <RECEIVE_FREQ>).

NOTE – Thus a received frequency observation would appear in an NDM/XML TDM as
       follows:
          <observation>
             <EPOCH>2008-200T12:34:56.789</EPOCH>
             <RECEIVE_FREQ>8415000000</RECEIVE_FREQ>
          </observation>

### 5.3.9 UNITS IN THE TDM/XML

The units associated with values in the TDM/XML shall be the same units used in the KVN-
formatted TDM and are as specified in table 3-5.

5.4     DISCUSSION—TDM/XML EXAMPLE

Figure E-21 provides a sample of a TDM in XML format.

# ANNEX A

          IMPLEMENTATION CONFORMANCE STATEMENT (ICS)

                                       (NORMATIVE)

A1       INTRODUCTION

A1.1      OVERVIEW

This annex provides the Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS) Requirements List
(RL) for an implementation of Tracking Data Message (CCSDS 503.0-B-2). The ICS for an
implementation is generated by completing the RL in accordance with the instructions
below. An implementation shall satisfy the mandatory conformance requirements referenced
in the RL. (For further information on Implementation Conformance Statements, see
reference [F6].)

The RL in this annex is blank. An implementation’s completed RL is called the ICS. The ICS
states which capabilities and options have been implemented. The following can use the ICS:
     –    the implementer, as a checklist to reduce the risk of failure to conform to the standard
          through oversight;
     –    a supplier or potential acquirer of the implementation, as a detailed indication of the
          capabilities of the implementation, stated relative to the common basis for
          understanding provided by the standard ICS proforma;
     –    a user or potential user of the implementation, as a basis for initially checking the
          possibility of interworking with another implementation (it should be noted that,
          while interworking can never be guaranteed, failure to interwork can often be
          predicted from incompatible ICSes);
     –    a tester, as the basis for selecting appropriate tests against which to assess the claim
          for conformance of the implementation.

A1.2      ABBREVIATIONS AND CONVENTIONS

The RL consists of information in tabular form. The status of features is indicated using the
abbreviations and conventions described below.

Item Column

The item column contains sequential numbers for items in the table.

Feature Column

The feature column contains a brief descriptive name for a feature. It implicitly means ‘Is
this feature supported by the implementation?’

NOTE – The features itemized in the RL are elements of a TDM. Therefore support for a
       mandatory feature indicates that generated messages will include that feature,
       and support for an optional feature indicates that generated messages can include
       that feature.

Keyword Column

The keyword column contains, where applicable, the TDM keyword associated with the
feature.

Reference Column

The reference column indicates the relevant subsection or table in Tracking Data Message
(CCSDS 503.0-B-2) (this document).

Status Column

The status column uses the following notations:
       M        mandatory.
       O        optional.

Support Column Symbols

The support column is to be used by the implementer to state whether a feature is supported
by entering Y, N, or N/A, indicating:
       Y        Yes, supported by the implementation.
       N        No, not supported by the implementation.
       N/A      Not applicable.

A1.3   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE RL

An implementer shows the extent of compliance to the Recommended Standard by
completing the RL; that is, the state of compliance with all mandatory requirements and the
options supported are shown. The resulting completed RL is called an ICS. The implementer
shall complete the RL by entering appropriate responses in the support or values-supported
column, using the notation described in A1.2. If a conditional requirement is inapplicable,
N/A should be used. If a mandatory requirement is not satisfied, exception information must
be supplied by entering a reference Xi, where i is a unique identifier, to an accompanying
rationale for the noncompliance.

           SECURITY, SANA, AND PATENT CONSIDERATIONS

                                    (INFORMATIVE)

C1     SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

C1.1    ANALYSIS OF SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

This annex subsection presents the results of an analysis of security considerations applied to
the technologies specified in this Recommended Standard.

C1.2    CONSEQUENCES OF NOT APPLYING SECURITY TO THE
        TECHNOLOGY

The consequences of not applying security to the systems and networks on which this
Recommended Standard is implemented could include potential loss, corruption, and theft of
data. Because these messages are used in spacecraft orbit determination analyses, the
consequences of not applying security to the systems and networks on which this
Recommended Standard is implemented could include compromise or loss of the mission if
malicious tampering of a particularly severe nature occurs.

C1.3    POTENTIAL THREATS AND ATTACK SCENARIOS

Potential threats or attack scenarios include, but are not limited to, (a) unauthorized access to
the programs/processes that generate and interpret the messages, (b) unauthorized access to
the messages during transmission between exchange partners, and (c) modification of the
messages between partners. Protection from unauthorized access during transmission is
especially important if the mission utilizes open ground networks, such as the Internet, to
provide ground-station connectivity for the exchange of data formatted in compliance with
this Recommended Standard. It is strongly recommended that potential threats or attack
scenarios applicable to the systems and networks on which this Recommended Standard is
implemented be addressed by the management of those systems and networks.

C1.4    DATA PRIVACY

Privacy of data formatted in compliance with the specifications of this Recommended
Standard should be assured by the systems and networks on which this Recommended
Standard is implemented.

C1.5   DATA INTEGRITY

Integrity of data formatted in compliance with the specifications of this Recommended
Standard should be assured by the systems and networks on which this Recommended
Standard is implemented.

C1.6   AUTHENTICATION OF COMMUNICATING ENTITIES

Authentication of communicating entities involved in the transport of data in compliance
with the specifications of this Recommended Standard should be provided by the systems
and networks on which this Recommended Standard is implemented.

C1.7   DATA TRANSFER BETWEEN COMMUNICATING ENTITIES

The transfer of data formatted in compliance with this Recommended Standard between
communicating entities should be accomplished via secure mechanisms approved by the
Information Technology Security functionaries of exchange participants.

C1.8   CONTROL OF ACCESS TO RESOURCES

Control of access to resources should be managed by the systems upon which originator
formatting and recipient processing are performed.

C1.9   AUDITING OF RESOURCE USAGE

Auditing of resource usage should be handled by the management of systems and networks
on which this Recommended Standard is implemented.

C1.10 UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

Unauthorized access to the programs/processes that generate and interpret the messages
should be prohibited in order to minimize potential threats and attack scenarios.

C1.11 DATA SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICS

Specific information-security interoperability provisions that may apply between agencies
and other independent users involved in an exchange of data formatted in compliance with
this Recommended Standard should be specified in an ICD.

C2       SANA CONSIDERATIONS

The following TDM-related items will be registered with the SANA Operator. The registration
rule for new entries in the registry is the approval of new requests by the CCSDS Area or
Working Group responsible for the maintenance of the TDM at the time of the request. New
requests for this registry should be sent to the SANA (mailto:info@sanaregistry.org).
     –    the TDM XML schema;
     –    values for the TIME_SYSTEM keyword in https://sanaregistry.org/r/time_systems
          (reference [12]);
     –    values for the REFERENCE_FRAME keyword in
          https://sanaregistry.org/r/celestial_body_reference_frames (reference [13]); and
     –    values for the ORIGINATOR keyword in
          https://sanaregistry.org/r/organizations/organizations.html (reference [11]). The
          CCSDS Navigation Working Group has no purview over the contents of this registry.
          Suggestions should be sent to the SANA Operator at info@sanaregistry.org.

C3       PATENT CONSIDERATIONS

The recommendations of this document have no patent issues.

# ANNEX D

          ITEMS FOR AN INTERFACE CONTROL DOCUMENT

                                   (INFORMATIVE)
In several places in this document there are references to items which should be specified in
an Interface Control Document (ICD) between agencies participating in an exchange of
tracking data, if they are applicable to the particular exchange. The ICD should be jointly
produced by both Agencies participating in a cross-support activity involving the collection,
analysis, and transfer of tracking data. This section compiles those items into a single
location.

The greater the amount of material specified via ICD, the lesser the utility/benefit of the
TDM (custom programming may be required to tailor software for each ICD).                 It is
suggested to avoid a large number of items specified via ICD, to ensure full utility/benefit of
the TDM.

For example, although turnaround ratios may not change frequently, having a TDM producer
include      the    turnaround     keywords      TURNAROUND_NUMERATOR                and
TURNAROUND_DENOMINATOR in the TDM will increase the level of automation
possible in an exchange partner’s TDM reader.

From an implementation standpoint, it is probable that many of the items that need to be
negotiated via ICD will be introduced into the system that processes tracking data via one or
more configuration files that specify the settings of specific, related parameters that will be
used during the tracking session, for example, the value of the turnaround ratio to be used for
the tracking data. This may vary between exchange participants. Different versions of
programs could be used to prepare the tracking data where these parameters differ; however,
a more efficient design would be to have a single program that is configured based on
tracking-pass-specific information. It seems likely that there may be at least two
configuration files necessary, one which contains Agency-specific parameters that do not
change between tracking passes, and one which contains spacecraft/mission-specific
parameters that could change with every tracking pass.

Another thought on ICDs is that it might be feasible for participating agencies to have a
generic baseline ICD (‘standard service provider ICD’) that specifies mission/spacecraft-
independent entities on the interface, for example, those associated with the agency’s ground
antennas (axis offsets, station locations, side motions, reference frame, epoch, supported
frequency bands, etc.). Then smaller ICDs could be used for the mission/spacecraft-specific
arrangements.

The following table lists the items that should be covered in an ICD, along with where they
are discussed in the text:

The following are some additional scenarios that are not currently considered in the example
set, but could be included in later versions of the TDM:
   a) spacecraft-to-spacecraft crosslinks;
   b) ground-based transponder;
   c) ‘DORIS’;
   d) arrayed downlink;
   e) orbital debris example;
   f) combination of radiometric types with media or meteorological data.

             RATIONALE FOR TRACKING DATA MESSAGES

                                   (INFORMATIVE)
G1   GENERAL

This annex presents the rationale behind the design of the Tracking Data Message. It may
help the application engineer construct a suitable message. Corrections and/or additions to
these requirements may occur during future updates.

A specification of requirements agreed to by all parties is essential to focus design and to
ensure the product meets the needs of the Member Agencies. There are many ways of
organizing requirements, but the categorization of requirements is not as important as the
agreement to a sufficiently comprehensive set. In this section, the requirements are organized
into three categories:

Primary Requirements - These are the most elementary and necessary requirements. They
would exist no matter the context in which the CCSDS is operating, that is, regardless of pre-
existing conditions within the CCSDS or its Member Agencies.

Heritage Requirements - These are additional requirements that derive from pre-existing
Member Agency requirements, conditions, or needs. Ultimately these carry the same weight
as the Primary Requirements. This Recommended Standard reflects heritage requirements
pertaining to some of the technical participants’ home institutions collected during the
preparation of the Recommended Standard; it does not speculate on heritage requirements
that could arise from other Member Agencies.

Desirable Characteristics - These are not requirements, but they are felt to be important or
useful features of the Recommended Standard.

The tables in the following pages of this annex show the association between data types and
metadata keywords. There are only a few required metadata keywords, but many more that
are applicable to one or more of the various data types. Additionally, there are some
keywords that are only applicable in certain restricted situations. Finally, there are some
metadata keywords that are completely optional. This summary may assist the user in
constructing a TDM that captures the data from a specific measurement session.
